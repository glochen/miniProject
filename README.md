It's the pin jumping game from Cracker Barrel. Jump pins to remove them.

What the things do:

LCD:
Before game begins: Welcome screen, game mode select.
In game: selected slot number, move-to slot number. Pins still remaining?
End of game: Pins remaining. Call the player an idiot. Time spent? Perhaps high scores.
Notes:
LCD1 - Welcome, selected slot number, move-to slot number, pegs left at end of game, message
LCD2 - Game selection mode, pins remaining during game, recommended slots, timer 


Slots:
Color to indicate if a pin is there or slot is empty.
When a slot with a pin is selected, change the color. The empty slots around it will also change color to indicate legal moves and recommended move.
